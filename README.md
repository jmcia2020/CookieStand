## Salmon Cookie: Getting Started 

Problem Domain:

Your friend Pat has come up with a business idea by combining two signature Seattle icons: Pat has developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. These cookies made into the shape of a salmon that has just a hint of fishy goodness.

Pat needs some help with the branding of the business, as well as some help with internal data management for the company, and has enlisted your assistance because of your extensive and proven work in developing web applications.

Patâ€™s Salmon Cookies, soon with franchises internationally, needs to calculate the number of cookies each location must make every day so that it can manage its supplies inventory and baking schedule. The number of cookies to make depends on the hours of operation (6:00 AM to 8:00 PM for all locations) and a few factors unique to each location:

The minimum number of customers per hour.
The maximum number of customers per hour.
The average number of cookies purchased per customer.

Build an application that is:
Adaptable that allows one to add and remove locations from the daily projections report.
Need to be able to easily modify the input numbers for each location based on day of the week, special events, and other factors. 
Need see these numbers with nice formatting in a web application.
