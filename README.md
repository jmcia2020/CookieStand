## Salmon Cookie: Getting Started 

Problem Domain:

Your friend Pat has come up with a business idea by combining two signature Seattle icons: Pat has developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. These cookies made into the shape of a salmon that has just a hint of fishy goodness.

Pat needs some help with the branding of the business, as well as some help with internal data management for the company, and has enlisted your assistance because of your extensive and proven work in developing web applications.
